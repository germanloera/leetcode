    You are given two integers L and R.
    Their values are initially set to L = 0 and R = 1

    You can change their values by performing the following commands:
        *  The Command 'L' changes the value of L to 2 * L - R
        *  The Command 'R' changes the values of R to 2 * R - L

     You are given an integer N. The goal is to Find the shortest sequence
     of commands after which L = N or R = N.

     For example, consider N = -11: the shortest sequence of commands required
     to set either L or R to -11 ['L','L','R','L']. After each command the values L and R
     are as follows

        *   Initial Values: L = 0, R = 1
        *   Command L:
